Hi I am **William Collins**!

I am a developer at Red Hat specializing in building enterprise integration components and solutions for [**JBoss Fuse**](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-jboss-fuse).

In this blog I discuss a variety of integration topics involving JBoss Fuse. In particular I focus on integration with SAP and EDI.
